Welcome!
========
I'm Andrew Hill, a composer currently studying at Oklahoma Baptist University.
I love to tell stories with my music, whether I'm writing for narrative media like theatre, film, or video games,
or writing music for music's sake.

About Me
========
I'm a senior composition major at Oklahoma Baptist University.
While I love writing music for music's sake, my primary interest is scoring narrative works
such as film, theatre productions, video games, and tabletop RPG campaigns.
Past and current projects include:
- Personal DnD campaign, titled *Thanes of the Nameless Spark* (Ongoing)
- [Theatricks](https://www.theatricks.org/) production of *House at Pooh Corner* (Summer 2019)
- *Worlds*, a series of solo piano pieces exploring music's ability to excite
  the visual and narrative imagination. (Ongoing, two pieces published already!)

My stylistic influences include:
- Impressionist composers, especially Claude Debussy
- Film composers, including John Powell, John Williams, and Danny Elfman
- Folk music in the Celtic and American traditions
- Video game composers, including Koji Kondo, Toby Fox, and Christopher Larkin

I'm a performer as well; I have had the honor of performing with the following ensembles:
- Bison Glee Club (tenor)
- Bison Jazz Orchestra (bass guitar)
- OBU Symphonic Winds (double bass)
- OBU/Shawnee Community Orchestra (double bass)

I also enjoy working with computers and computer programming.
In fact, I was a computer science major for my first two years of college!

I also wrote this website myself,
using [saait](https://codemadness.org/saait.html) and [smu](https://github.com/Gottox/smu).
