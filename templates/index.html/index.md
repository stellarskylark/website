Welcome!
========
I'm Skylar Hill, a composer currently studying at Oklahoma Baptist University.
I love to tell stories with my music, whether I'm writing for narrative media like theatre, film, or video games,
or writing music for music's sake.

Welcome to my website!

About Me
========
While I love writing music for music's sake, my primary interest is scoring narrative works
such as film, theatre productions, video games, and tabletop RPG campaigns.
Past and current projects include:
- Personal DnD campaign, titled *Thanes of the Nameless Spark* (Ongoing)
- [Theatricks](https://www.theatricks.org/) production of *House at Pooh Corner* (Summer 2019)
- *Worlds*, a series of solo piano pieces exploring music's ability to excite
  the visual and narrative imagination. (Ongoing, two pieces published already!)

My stylistic influences include:
- Impressionist composers, especially Claude Debussy
- Film composers, including John Powell, John Williams, and Danny Elfman
- Folk music in the Celtic and American traditions
- Video game composers, including Koji Kondo, Toby Fox, and Christopher Larkin

I'm a performer as well; I have had the honor of performing with the following ensembles:
- Bison Glee Club (tenor)
- Bison Jazz Orchestra (bass guitar)
- OBU Symphonic Winds (double bass)
- OBU/Shawnee Community Orchestra (double bass)

I also enjoy working with computers and computer programming.
In fact, I was a computer science major for my first two years of college!
If you're interested in that sort of thing, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/stellarskylark)!
I also wrote this website myself,
using [saait](https://codemadness.org/saait.html) and [smu](https://github.com/Gottox/smu).
