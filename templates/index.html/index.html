<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>I'm Skylar Hill, a composer currently studying at Oklahoma Baptist University.
I love to tell stories with my music, whether I'm writing for narrative media like theatre, film, or video games,
or writing music for music's sake.</p>
<p>Welcome to my website!</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>While I love writing music for music's sake, my primary interest is scoring narrative works
such as film, theatre productions, video games, and tabletop RPG campaigns.
Past and current projects include:
<ul>
<li>Personal DnD campaign, titled <em>Thanes of the Nameless Spark</em> (Ongoing)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theatricks.org/">Theatricks</a> production of <em>House at Pooh Corner</em> (Summer 2019)</li>
<li><em>Worlds</em>, a series of solo piano pieces exploring music's ability to excite
the visual and narrative imagination. (Ongoing, two pieces published already!)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>My stylistic influences include:
<ul>
<li>Impressionist composers, especially Claude Debussy</li>
<li>Film composers, including John Powell, John Williams, and Danny Elfman</li>
<li>Folk music in the Celtic and American traditions</li>
<li>Video game composers, including Koji Kondo, Toby Fox, and Christopher Larkin</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>I'm a performer as well; I have had the honor of performing with the following ensembles:
<ul>
<li>Bison Glee Club (tenor)</li>
<li>Bison Jazz Orchestra (bass guitar)</li>
<li>OBU Symphonic Winds (double bass)</li>
<li>OBU/Shawnee Community Orchestra (double bass)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>I also enjoy working with computers and computer programming.
In fact, I was a computer science major for my first two years of college!
